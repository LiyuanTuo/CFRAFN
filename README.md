# CFRAFN: A Deep Learning Model for Depression Recognition Based on Attention Mechanism and Integrated Mixed Features
Cross-Feature Residual Attention Fusion Network (CFRAFN), which leverages eGeMAPS features along with high-dimensional embeddings extracted from the pre-trained VGGish model to effectively capture depression-associated phonetic patterns. Specifically, the CFRAFN utilizes differentiated residual blocks to maintain training stability in deep hierarchical structure. Furthermore, the self-attention fusion strategy dynamically weights the significance of each feature modality, ensuring effective feature integration and consequently improving depression prediction accuracy.
